# Movie-Recommender-Engine

Developed a movie recommender engine where user wil be recommended a movie based on genre, rating and director of movie.

Used collaborative and content based methods to make a movie recommending engine. 
Combined both methods to make it into hybrid recommender engine.

User just needs to input user ID and the movie title and the engine would recommend the results with all the top 10 similar movies with their ratings and genres.
